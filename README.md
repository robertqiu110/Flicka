# Flicka
Frontend for [flicka.app](https://flicka.app), a progressive web app that I made to learn React.js and exercise my data science skills. Flicka is a simple movie recommendations engine, but unlike similar sites, it allows you to select multiple movies and it'll find movies similar to your selections as a group. For example, you may select a romance movie and a comedy movie, and it will return rom com movies. The goal of this app is to make movie hunting easier, so I went with a simple, minimalistic design that is extremely easy to use.

Flicka utilizes the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/25m/) and [TMDb's](https://www.themoviedb.org/) database of movies.
